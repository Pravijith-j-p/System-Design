## üìå What is System Design?

System Design is the process of **planning the architecture, components, and data flow of a software system** to meet requirements like scalability, reliability, and performance.  

> "System design is about building software systems that work efficiently, scale with users, and handle failures gracefully."

<details>
<summary>üîë Key Goals</summary>

- **Scalability** ‚Äì Handle more users and data efficiently.  
- **Reliability** ‚Äì Ensure consistent system operation.  
- **Maintainability** ‚Äì Enable easy addition of features.  
- **Performance** ‚Äì Fast response times and optimal resource usage.  
- **Security** ‚Äì Protect data from unauthorized access.  
</details>

## üèóÔ∏è When is System Design Needed?

- Building **large-scale applications** (Facebook, YouTube, Uber).  
- Handling **millions of users** or **high data volumes**.  
- Ensuring **high availability and fault tolerance**.  
- Designing **databases, caching, messaging, and APIs** efficiently.

## üß© Types of System Design

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

### 1. High-Level Design (HLD)  
- Focuses on **overall architecture**  
- Components: servers, databases, APIs, cache, message queues  
- Diagrams show **modules and interactions**

### 2. Low-Level Design (LLD)  
- Focuses on **detailed implementation**  
- Classes, methods, data structures, DB schema  
- Diagrams show **internal component interactions**

- **Scalability:** Vertical vs Horizontal scaling  
- **Load Balancing:** Round-robin, Least Connections, Geo Load Balancing  
- **Caching:** LRU, LFU, Redis, Memcached  
- **Database Design:** SQL vs NoSQL, Sharding, Replication  
- **Indexing & Search:** Full-text search, ElasticSearch  
- **Message Queues:** Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS  
- **Consistency & Availability:** CAP theorem, Eventual vs Strong consistency  
- **CDN & Edge Caching**  
- **Monitoring & Metrics:** Prometheus, Grafana

## üõ†Ô∏è System Design Approach for MAANG

1. **Clarify Requirements** ‚Äì Functional vs Non-functional, scale, latency, read/write ratio  
2. **Define APIs & Data Model** ‚Äì Identify entities, relationships, schema  
3. **Design High-Level Architecture** ‚Äì Components: API Gateway, Load Balancer, DB, Cache  
4. **Handle Scale & Performance** ‚Äì Sharding, caching, async processing  
5. **Ensure Reliability & Consistency** ‚Äì DB replication, failover strategies  
6. **Security & Monitoring** ‚Äì Auth, rate limiting, logging, metrics  
7. **Draw Diagrams** ‚Äì Clear end-to-end flow of system components

## üìö Common System Design Questions

| System | Key Points |
|--------|------------|
| **Twitter/Facebook Feed** | Timeline generation (push vs pull), caching, fanout, rate limiting |
| **YouTube/Video Streaming** | Video storage, CDN, transcoding, recommendation system |
| **Uber/Taxi Booking** | Geospatial indexing, matching, surge pricing, real-time updates |
| **WhatsApp/Messenger** | Messaging queue, delivery guarantees, typing indicators |
| **Instagram/Photo Sharing** | Media storage, caching, feed generation, notifications |
| **E-Commerce Website** | Product catalog, search, recommendation, payments |
| **Google Drive/Dropbox** | File storage, deduplication, syncing, sharing |

## üí° Tips for MAANG Interviews

- **Think out loud:** Explain reasoning and trade-offs  
- **Start simple:** Propose simple design first, then scale  
- **Focus on bottlenecks:** Identify performance issues  
- **Practice common systems:** Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Uber, WhatsApp  
- **Use diagrams:** Clarity is more important than artistic detail

## ‚ö° Summary

System design is a critical skill for **MAANG interviews**. Focus on **core concepts, scalability, reliability, and trade-offs**, and practice explaining designs clearly with diagrams.
